I changed EDA a little bit by adding new plot for correlation with new column in dataset spell_err that has number of error in the text, also i have changed the validation process, 3 prompts has left for training and one was left for validation, because in test dataset it will be big quantity of new prompts, also I have tried new type of word vectorization: Bag of words and Tf-Idf and sentence embedings: Spacy, BERT# ComonLitAttempt2
